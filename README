== Changes

* Sparse ARFF files (thanks to Tom Adams)


== Todo

* Spaces or quotes in nominal types
* Commas in quoted attributes or in nominal types
* Add error checking/validation
* Creation of sparse ARFF files
* Missing values - '?'
* Dates - do some work to create, translate, and interpret date format strings.


== Weka

Weka is "a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks."
(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)  Weka accompanies the following book:

Ian H. Witten and Eibe Frank (2005) "Data Mining: Practical machine learning
tools and techniques", 2nd Edition, Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 2005.


== ARFF Information

ARFF files are similar to CSV files, but are strongly-typed, have a pre-defined
set of data types, and include a sparse representation.
