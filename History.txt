== Changes

=== 0.2.2 (unofficial)

* Handles boolean inputs, which are modelled as nominals
* Handles spaces in nominals, which are replaced by underscores. Probably should be quoting these, but is good enough for me right now

=== 0.2.1 (unofficial)

* Handles missing data in output, encoded internally as nil values

== 0.2.0 ?

* Sparse ARFF files (thanks to Tom Adams)
